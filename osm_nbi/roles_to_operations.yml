roles_to_operations:

##
# This file defines the mapping between user roles and operation permission.
# It uses the following pattern:
#
#    - role: <ROLE_NAME>
#      operations:
#        "<OPERATION>": true | false
#
# <ROLE_NAME> defines the name of the role. This name will be matched with an
# existing role in the RBAC system.
#
# NOTE: The role will only be used if there is an existing match. If there
#       isn't a role in the system that can be matched, the operation permissions
#       won't yield any result.
#
# operations: is a list of operation permissions for the role. An operation
# permission is defined using the following pattern:
#
#    "<OPERATION>": true | false
#
# The operations are defined using an hierarchical tree. For this purpose, an
# <OPERATION> tag can represents the path for the following:
#    - Root
#    - Node
#    - Leaf
#
# The root <OPERATION> tag is defined using "." and the default value is false.
# When you use this tag, all the operation permissions will be set to the value
# assigned.
# NOTE 1: The default value is false. So if a value isn't specified, it will
#         default to false.
# NOTE 2: The root <OPERATION> tag can be overridden by using more specific tags
#         with a different value.
#
# The node <OPERATION> tag is defined by using an internal node of the tree, i.e.
# "nsds", "users.id". A node <OPERATION> tag will affect all the nodes and leafs
# beneath it. It can be used to override a root <OPERATION> tag.
# NOTE 1: It can be overridden by using a more specific tag, such as a node which
#         is beneath it or a leaf.
#
# The leaf <OPERATION> tag is defined by using a leaf of the tree, i.e. "users.post",
# "ns_instances.get", "vim_accounts.id.get". A leaf <OPERATION> tag will override all
# the values defined by the parent nodes, since it is the more specific tag that can
# exist.
#
# General notes:
#    - In order to find which tags are in use, check the resources_to_operations.yml.
#    - In order to find which roles are in use, check the RBAC system.
#    - Non existing tags will be ignored.
#    - Tags finishing in a dot (excluding the root <OPERATION> tag) will be ignored.
#    - The anonymous role allows to bypass the role definition for paths that
#      shouldn't be verified.
